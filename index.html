      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello,
        For most of my adult life I've been an actor. I was a full-time actor in my early twenties and even graduated with an MFA from Louisiana State University last year. Now I'm looking to add another layer to repetoire and that is why I'm taking this Bootcamp! I hope use the knoweledge I gain here to work on different and exciting projects.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from small town in Massachusetts called, Hudson. But I've also lived in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Los Angeles.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Aside from acting, working out, watching movies, photography, live concerts, live events in general...Oh and motorcycles! Love motorcycles.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>At the moment this area of my life is in flux. It used to be actor, now I only want to work on projects that I want to work on. So, if I can work as an actor for one project, then great. I'd also like to produce and after this bootcamp, I want to work on multiple web developing projects. My dream job is whatever allows me to work from whereever in the world at any given time.</I></p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in my hometown of Hudson, MA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web Developing is interesting to me because of all of its real world applications. I like the idea of being about to work as a freelancer while still earning a living wage. I'd be able to use my free time to develop other ideas and businesses and having this knowledge would help me implement web developming skills in theses new businesses.</p>
